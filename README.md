$ ./build.sh

# Run the app (Linux)
$ ./run.sh
```
On Windows:
```batch
:: Build the app (Windows)
C:\> build.bat

:: Run the app (Windows x86)
C:\> runwinx64.bat

## Future plans
- Finish Color Picker implementation
- Simple shapes like lines, rectangles, circles and triangles
- Layer Window (and easy way to change order of layers)
- ToolBox with all available tools
- More keybindings like Ctrl+O to open a file
- Finally learn how to use Java Executable Wrapper

## What we used in this project?
- OpenCV Libray (matrix operations, kernel generating and applying effects)
- Flatlaf (Themes)
